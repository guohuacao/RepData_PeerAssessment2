Analysis of different weather events in the USA based on the NOAA Storm Database, their impacts on human induries and economic damages
======================

This is an R Markdown document for Coursera course Reproducible Research project Peer Assessments 2. 
The course assignment can be found here https://class.coursera.org/repdata-033/human_grading/view/courses/975146/assessments/4/submissions

##1, Assignment

The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. You must use the database to answer the questions below and show the code for your entire analysis. 

Your data analysis must address the following questions:

* Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

* Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

##2, Synopsis
Storm and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many sever events can results in fatalities, injuries and property damage. Preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, include when and where they occur, aswell as estimates of any fatalities, injuries and property damage. This report contains the exploratory analysis results on the health and economic impact by the severe weather events based on the data from NOAA database.

##3, Data Processing
Download and Read the data file from course assignment website

####3.1 Load libraries
```{r, results= 'hide', message=FALSE}
library(R.utils) # for bunzip2

library(dplyr) # 

```
####3.2 download file from URL, read the data into R
```{r}
downloadData <- function() {
    if (!file.exists("./repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2")) {
        download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2", 
                      "./repdata-data-StormData.csv")
    }
    # unzip file
    if (!file.exists("repdata-data-StormData.csv")) {
        
        bunzip2("./repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2", "./repdata-data-StormData.csv", remove = FALSE)
    }
}

needLoadData <- TRUE
if(needLoadData){
    downloadData()
    # load data into R
    storm <- read.csv("./repdata-data-StormData.csv")
    head(storm, 2)
}
```

####3.4 Reduce the data based on the column that we need for this analysis
reduce storm data, only keep needed column: BGN_DATE, EVTYPE, FATALITIES, INJURIES, PROPDMG, PROPDMGEXP, CROPDMG, CROPDMGEXP

```{r}
keepCol <- c("BGN_DATE", "EVTYPE", "FATALITIES", "INJURIES", "PROPDMG", "PROPDMGEXP", "CROPDMG", "CROPDMGEXP")
reducedStormData <- storm[, keepCol]
```


####3.5 Reduce the data by year and date
There are 902297 rows and 8 columns in reduced Storm Data. The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of reliable/complete records.
```{r}
reducedStormData$year <- as.numeric(format(as.Date(reducedStormData$BGN_DATE, format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S"), "%Y"))

hist(reducedStormData$year, breaks = 30)
quantile(reducedStormData$year, 0.25)
```

Histogram shows that 1995 to 2011 covers 75% of the total record collected. We will reduce the data starting from 1995

```{r}
rStorm <- reducedStormData[reducedStormData$year >= 1995, ]
dim(rStorm)
```


##4, Results

####4.1, Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

There two typse of data are analysized, fatality and indury. 

```{r}
rStorm_tbl <- tbl_df(rStorm)
byFATALITIES <- group_by(rStorm_tbl, EVTYPE)
top10Fatalities<- summarise(byFATALITIES,
                total = sum(FATALITIES)
) %>% arrange(desc(total)) %>% top_n(10)

top10Fatalities
```     

Excess Heat caused most of the fatalities.

```{r}
byINJURIES <- group_by(rStorm_tbl, EVTYPE)
top10Induries <- summarise(byINJURIES ,
                 total = sum(INJURIES)
) %>% arrange(desc(total)) %>% top_n(10)

top10Induries
```

Tornado caused most of the injuries. 

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
barplot(top10Induries$total, 
        names = top10Fatalities$EVTYPE,
        xlab = "Event Type",
        ylab = "Total Deaths",
        main = "Top 10 Fatal Weather Events")


barplot(top10Induries$total, 
        names = top10Induries$EVTYPE,
        xlab = "Event Type",
        ylab = "Total Deaths",
        main = "Top 10 Injuries Weather Events")
```


####4.2, Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
We will convert the property damage and crop damage data into comparable numerical forms using the definition of the units described in the code book (Storm Events). Both PROPDMGEXP and CROPDMGEXP columns record a multiplier for each observation where we have Hundred (H), Thousand (K), Million (M) and Billion (B).

Helper function to convert symbol to a power of 10 (for use with PROPDMGEXP & CROPDMGEXP)
```{r}
toTenPower <- function(x){
    if(is.numeric(x)) {
        x <- x
    }
    else if(grepl("h", x, ignore.case=TRUE)) {
        x <- 2
    }
    else if(grepl("k", x, ignore.case=TRUE)) {
        x <- 3
    }
    else if(grepl("m", x, ignore.case=TRUE)) {
        x <- 6
    }
    else if(grepl("b", x, ignore.case=TRUE)) {
        x <- 9
    }
    else if(x == "" || x == " "){
        x <- 0
    }
    else{
        x <- NA
    }
    x
}
# function to take two parameters num and exp and convert it to one absolute value. non integers become 0
calculateAmount <- function(num, exp){
    pow <- toTenPower(exp)
    if(is.numeric(num)){
        num <- num * (10 ^ pow)
    }
    
    if(!is.numeric(num)){
        num <- 0
    }
    
    num
}
```

create 2 new fields for calculated propDamage & cropDamage and add them to one damageTotal field

```{r}
rStorm$propDamage <- mapply(calculateAmount, rStorm$PROPDMG, rStorm$PROPDMGEXP)
rStorm$cropDamage <- mapply(calculateAmount, rStorm$CROPDMG, rStorm$CROPDMGEXP)

propDam <- aggregate(propDamage~EVTYPE, data=rStorm, sum)
propDam_reorder<- propDam[order(-propDam$propDamage),]
propDam10<-propDam_reorder[1:10,]

cropDam <- aggregate(cropDamage~EVTYPE, data=rStorm, sum)
cropDam_reorder<- cropDam[order(-cropDam$cropDamage),]
cropDam10<-cropDam_reorder[1:10,]

totalDam <- aggregate(propDamage + cropDamage~EVTYPE, data=rStorm, sum)
names(totalDam)[2] <- "total"
totalDam10 <- arrange(totalDam, desc(total)) %>% top_n(10)
```

List out the tables for property damage, crop damange, and total damage.

```{r}
propDam10
cropDam10
totalDam10
```


```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
barplot(propDam10$propDamage, 
        names = propDam10$EVTYPE,
        cex.names = 0.7,
        cex.axis = 0.7,
        xlab = "Event Type",
        ylab = "Total Property Damage ($)",
        main = "Top 10 Events Causing \n Most Property Damage")
barplot(cropDam10$cropDamage, 
        names = cropDam10$EVTYPE,
        cex.names = 0.7,
        cex.axis = 0.7,
        xlab = "Event Type",
        ylab = "Total Crop Damage ($)",
        main = "Top 10 Events Causing \n Most Crop Damage")
barplot(totalDam10$total, 
        names = totalDam10$EVTYPE,
        cex.names = 0.7,
        cex.axis = 0.7,
        xlab = "Event Type",
        ylab = "Total Crop Damage ($)",
        main = "Top 10 Events Causing \n Most Total Damage")
```

Based on the data, FLOOD caused the most property damage. DROUGHT caused the most crop damange. FLOOD caused the most total damage.
